# CSSE230, Exam Review Session 1

This GitHub repo contains two different parts:
1. The paper portion of the practice exam
2. The coding portion of the practice exam.

The paper portion should look somewhat familiar if you've taken a look at the posted sample exams, just with different questions of the same style.

The coding portion will contain a unique problem that challenges you to make a "new" data structure that is similar to a Queue, just with some features added and some removed.

If you'd like to read more exact details, see the [Coding Portion Details document](/evens-odds-queue/src/codingPortionDetails.md)
